# architectural_frameworks
Software frameworks for software and enterprise applications

I've compiled these frameworks, so I have a reference for some of the designs that I'm going to be using for specific categories, whether it's government contracting or just regular old cloud diagrams that follow the recommended architecture. I will include a couple of my designs and also recommendations for specific frameworks in specific situations. This library will be quite comprehensive but it's more to be used as a reference guide than anything else.
